title: Deploying Your Product as a Tile in Ops Manager
---

This topic describes the procedure for deploying a Cloud Foundry software product as a tile in Ops Manager. Ops Manager offers a web GUI and eases the process of deploying software with BOSH by providing the following:

- Automated error checking
- Automated manifest generation
- Life cycle management for upgrading a product when a new release is published.

 <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Before beginning this procedure, you should follow the procedure described in [Deploying a PCF Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).</p>

## <a id='deploy-ops-manager'></a>Step 1: Deploy Ops Manager

Ops Manager is available on [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io). For the purpose of this step we will launch an Amazon AMI in the VPC we used in [Deploying a PCF Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).

1. Login to [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io) and download the latest Ops Manager for AWS. This is a PDF with the AMI ID.

1. Login to the **AWS Console**.

1. Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard**.

1. Click **Launch Instance**.

1. Select **Community AMIs** and search for the Ops Manager AMI as printed in the PDF you downloaded from Pivotal Network.

1. Click the **Select** button next to the Ops Manager AMI.

1. Choose an m3.large instance and click Next: Configure Instance Details.

1. Click the dropdown for the **Network** key and choose the VPC you created in [Deploying Your Product with Bosh](./deploying-with-bosh.html#prep-environment).

1. Click the dropdown for the **Subnet** key and choose the public subnet you created in [Deploying Your Product with Bosh](./deploying-with-bosh.html#prep-environment).

1. Set **Auto-assign Public IP** to **Enable**.
<%= image_tag 'vpc.png' %>

1. Click **Review and Launch**.

1. Edit the Security Group and set it to the OpsManagerSecurityGroup you used in [Deploying Your Product with Bosh](./deploying-with-bosh.html).

1. Click **Launch**.

1. Choose the keypair you created in [Deploying Your Product with Bosh](./deploying-with-bosh.html) and accept the aknowledgement checkbox.
<%= image_tag 'keypair.png' %>

1. Click **Launch Instance**.

## <a id='configure-install'></a>Step 2: Configure and Install Ops Manager Director

1. Find the public IP address of the Ops Manager you deployed in the EC2 Dashboard.

1. Open a browser and navigate to the Ops Manager IP address.

1. Create a username and password, and agree to the terms and conditions.
<%= image_tag 'username-pass.png' %>

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director** Tile.<br>
<%= image_tag 'director.png' %>

1. Enter the **Access Key**, **Secret**, **VPC ID**, **Security Group**, **Key Pair**, **Private Key** and **Region** with the values you used in [Deploying a PCF Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).

1. Click **Save**.
<%= image_tag 'aws-config.png' %>

1. Select **Director Config**.

1. Enter an Amazon NTP Server (0.amazon.pool.ntp.org) and click Save.

1. Select **Create Availability Zone**.

1. Enter the Availability Zone for the private subnet of your VPC (example: us-west-1a) and click **Save**.

1. Select **Assign Availability Zone**.

1. Choose the Availability Zone you created and click **Save**.

1. Select **Create Networks**.

1. Enter a **network name**, **Subnet ID**, **CIDR Range**, **Excluded IP range**, **DNS**, and **gateway** using the same values you used in [Deploying a PCF Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: you will get errors that Ops Manager cannot reach the gateway or DNS server.</p>
<%= image_tag 'networks.png' %>

1. Select **Assign Networks**.

1. Choose the network you created and click **Save**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** and wait until the Ops Manager Director is successfully installed. 

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you have existing VMs in the VPC you will recieve errors that IP addresses are already in use.</p>

## <a id='examine-example'></a>Step 3: Download and Examine the Example Product Tile

We will learn how to build an product tile by examining its contents.

1. Download the latest release of the [Example Product Tile](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/ops-manager-example/releases).

1. Change the extension from `.pivotal` to `.zip` and unzip the file on your local workstation.

Study the files contained in the following directories using these explanations as a guide. Once you have looked at the files, we will deploy the tile, SSH into the Ops Manager, and explore how the tile functions.
<ul>
    <li>Content_migrations <strong>(optional)</strong>: Migrations for when an earlier version is upgraded.</li>
    <li>Metadata <strong>(required)</strong>: This directory includes a product template, which is how a product is rendered in Ops Manager, and instructions for how its BOSH manifest is generated.</li>
    <li>Releases <strong>(optional)</strong>: BOSH releases that contain the source code for a product. In this case, the release contains the NGINX webserver. </li>
</ul>

## <a id='build-your-own'></a>Step 4: Build your own Product Tile

Create your own product tile by following these high level instructions. Each instruction represents hours of work in which can refer to reference documentation for help.

1. Build and create a BOSH release. Information about how to build a release is found in the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/). You can ask questions of the BOSH community using the [CF-BOSH mailing list](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-bosh@lists.cloudfoundry.org/P) and [IRC Channel on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bosh).

2. Create a Product Template by using the Example Product Tile as a model. Refer to the [Product Template Reference](./product-template-reference.html) for clarification.

3. Consider adding Lifecycle Errands to both your BOSH release and your Product Template. Refer to the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/) and the [Lifecycle Errands](./lifecycle-errands.html) topic for more information. Consider what errands to include in your product tile.

4. Create folders according to the previous step, archive the folders into a `.zip` file and import the file into a deployed Ops Manager.

5. The fastest way to make changes to your product tile is to directly SSH into the Ops Manager VM and edit the product template at `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/metadata`. After making changes, refresh your browser to see the change. You can click **Apply Changes** in the PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and view the resulting BOSH manifest in `/var/tempest/workspace/default/deployments`.

6. You must create a migration file to migrate values in subsequent releases of your product. These files use a ruby gem known as Transmogrifier. Refer to the [Migrations](./migrations.html) section more information about building migrations.
